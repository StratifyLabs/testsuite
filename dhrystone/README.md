# Dhrystone Benchmark

The dhrystone benchmark is a program designed to benchmark compiler and processor execution in typical programming environments. This version is a Stratify OS application that can run the benchmark inside of Stratify OS. When run using the `sl bench.run` command, the results are automatically reported to the cloud so that they can be compared to other chips.

The dhrystone benchmark can be run on Stratify OS using the following commands:

```
sl bench.run:id=QpXcn3w2P1YUcatvAZZd
sl bench.run:id=QpXcn3w2P1YUcatvAZZd,ram
```
